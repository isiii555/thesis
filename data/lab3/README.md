# Quick Introduction

My thesis focuses on developing a hybrid process mining method for analyzing software system event logs, particularly in cases where correlation attributes like session IDs or request IDs are missing or inconsistent. The proposed approach combines rule-based and AI-assisted techniques—including template mining, semantic embeddings, and clustering—to construct valid process traces from heterogeneous logs. This enables the generation of accurate and interpretable process models, even in complex distributed environments.
